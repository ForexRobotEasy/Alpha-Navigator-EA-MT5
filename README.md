This code represents the implementation of a genetic algorithm for optimizing trading strategies. The algorithm aims to find the best set of parameters for a trading strategy by evaluating its success metrics such as profitability, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.

## Genetic Algorithm Implementation

### GenerateRandomPopulation()
This function generates a random population of trading strategy parameters.

### EvaluateStrategy()
This function measures the success metrics of a trading strategy and returns its fitness score.

### SelectBestStrategies()
This function identifies the strategies with the highest success metrics.

### Crossover()
This function generates new trading strategy parameters through crossover.

### Mutation()
This function generates new trading strategy parameters through mutation.

### CalculateFitness()
This function assesses the fitness of each trading strategy parameter.

### OptimizeStrategies()
This function implements the optimization loop using the genetic algorithm. It generates a random population, evaluates the fitness of each strategy, selects the best strategies, performs crossover and mutation, and repeats these steps for a given number of generations.

## Integration with MT5

### OnInit()
This function is called during the initialization of the EA. It initializes the code and calls the OptimizeStrategies() function to optimize the trading strategies.
